### 👋 Hi, I'm Ahamed Athil Khan

I'm currently learning **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, with a goal to become job-ready within 6 weeks.

🚀 What I’ve Learned:
- Classic ML Models: `Linear Regression`, `Logistic Regression`, `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and interactive user prediction

🛠️ Projects:
- [Linear Regression: House Price Prediction](https://github.com/iamathilkhan/linear_regression)
- [Logistic Regression: Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/iamathilkhan/logistic_regression)
- [KNN: Social Network Purchase Prediction](https://github.com/iamathilkhan/knn_model)

🎯 Currently Working On:
- Deep Learning: ANN, CNN, RNN
- Advanced ML Techniques
- Building more real-world AI projects
