Hi, I'm Ahamed Athil Khan.

I'm currently learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
I've completed basic projects using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors.  
I'm exploring deep learning (ANN, CNN, RNN) and working on improving my coding skills every day.

Check out my projects below!
