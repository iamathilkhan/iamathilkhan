### 👋 Hi, I'm Ahamed Athil Khan

I'm currently learning **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**

---

🚀 **What I’ve Learned So Far**
- Core ML Models: `Linear Regression`, `Logistic Regression`, `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`,`Decison tree`,`Random forest tree` and other classic models 
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and interactive prediction systems

---

🛠️ **Projects**

- 📈 [House Price Predictor (Linear Regression)](https://github.com/iamathilkhan/House-price-predictor)  
  Predicts housing prices based on key features like income, room count, and population.

- 🚢 [Titanic Survival Predictor (Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/iamathilkhan/Titanic-Survival-Predictor)  
  Classifies survival outcomes using passenger data such as age, gender, and class.

- 🛍️ [KNN Purchase Predictor (K-Nearest Neighbors)](https://github.com/iamathilkhan/KNN-purchase-predictor)  
  Predicts whether a user will make a purchase based on age and estimated salary.

🎯 **Currently Working On**
- Deep Learning: `ANN`, `CNN`, `RNN`
- Advanced AI Techniques
- More real-world project applications
